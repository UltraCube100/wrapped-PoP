Each transcation uses this format (without the curly brackets):

 #{transcation number} {sender's address} == {recipent's address} 
 +{amount being sent} 
 SENDER_BAL BF {sender's balance before transcation}
 SENDER_BAL AFT {sender's balance after transcation}
 RECIPENT_BAL BF {recipent's address before transcation}
 RECIPENT_BAL AFT {recipent's address before transcation}
 MSG = {transcation message} 

 Note that after the "+", "wPoP" is NOT placed, and that the transcation amount is to the precision of 0.01, even if the transcation amount is a whole number or it is only to the precision of 0.1. If there is no transcation message, the message is left as "NA"
 Example:

 #1 1-0x6ce52 == 1572-0xb59bc
 +25.00
 SENDER_BAL BF 150.00
 SENDER_BAL AFT 125.00
 RECIPENT_BAL BF 0.00
 RECIPENT_BAL AFT 25.00
 MSG = NA
